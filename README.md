## Dependencies

Having anaconda installed is preferable for running the program since it includes a 
large collection of pre-installed packages (not mandatory though). Aside that, no 
external installation is required beyond the standard Python libraries. However, this 
project uses numpy for numerical operations and Matplotlib for plotting, 
and scikit-learn for generating a synthetic dataset and splitting it. 
Ensure you have these libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Algorithms
### Linear Regression
This is a basic implementation of the linear regression algorithm from scratch in python. It is built to showcase
fundamental concepts including model fitting, prediction, evaluation and plots to demonstrate it's
performance after each iterative process. The implementation also includes, calculating the MSE and the coefficient 
of determination (RÂ² score) for model evaluation.

    Follow theses steps to run the program:

    $ git clone https://github.com/pmesah28/Basic-ML-Algorithms
    $ cd Basic-ML-Algorithms
    $ python3 Basic-ML-Algorithms/Test/linear_reg.py
